I know I am having a good time working on a lab or project when I have a hard time falling asleep at night.  When I'm lying in bed and I can't let go of what I am thinking about or can't stop planning on what I will work on the next day, I know I am enjoying myself.  It's a very different feeling from when I am worrying about something that I have to take care of tomorrow, or if I am trying to avoid having to deal with someone or something the next day.  When I am happy, and tossing and turning in bed with an energy that will not subside and I can't wait for the morning to come, to jump back into an assignment, it truly is one of the best feelings to have.  This happened most recently when I wrapped up the Music CLI lab.  I kept thinking about the methods and how they work with each other and how the objects were collaborating with one another either directly, or through another object.  It felt like the previous lessons all came together and the lab was telling a story.  It's times like these that you don't want to stop and go to bed.  It's like being wrapped up in a mystery and you see the pieces come together as you are about to solve "who done it".  It's hard to walk away.  

It is this kind of excitment and interest or lack there of, I should say, that brought forced me to make a change in my career.  As a PT, the work was fine, but not stimulating.  No puzzles to solve.  Don't get me wrong, I am not saying I knew all there was to know about PT and all my patients improved, but the "problem solving" aspect of it took more and more of a back seat to the every day interaction with the patient.  With coding, it feels like "problem solving" is what we do, day in and day out, and that can never get old to me!
