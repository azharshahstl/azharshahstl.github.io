I have been in the Flatiron on-line program for over a year now.  Yeah, over a year.  When I started I thought I would be done in 6-8 months.  Well, as they say, life is what happens to you while you are making plans.  Why it has taken me this long is not the focus of this Blog, but one thing is certain.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  

After I finished my CLI project and began the Sinatra section, I quickly realized that what I was hoping for was about to happen.  Sinatra and ActiveRecord opened my eyes to the wonder of creating apps and it only confirmed that coding is what I want to do for the rest of my life.  I couldn't wait to get to my Sinatra project and bring to life my idea of creating a way to store board games.  As a lover of them, I thought it would not only be fun, but practical.  And now that I am finished, I can say it was more fun than I could have thought it could be.  

Using everything I had learned in the Sinatra section to create my app andplaying around with ideas and testing them out, was some of the most fullfiling work I have ever done.  I could not believe how quickly, thinking and writing code was becoming so natural to me.  It was a giant leap forward.  In my CLI project  I felt like I was thinking in my native language and then translating to Ruby, which was cumbersome and slow.  My Sinatra project has made me feel like not only was I made to do this, but I will thrive in web development.  

For anyone out there in the CLI section who is struggling, or perhaps second guessing themselves, hang in there.  If you can, take some time to explore what you are learning in other ways.  Don't rush through the material but allow yourself to slowly absorb it and become comfortable with the syntax and way of thinking.  Trust me, you will then be rewarded with Sinatra and everything will make sense.  Now, if Sinatra has made me this giddy, I wonder what Rails is going to do to me?
