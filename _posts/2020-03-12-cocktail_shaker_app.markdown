In response to my love of drinking the best cocktails, I decided to make an app to allow users to create delicious cocktails and share them with the world!  After users, (I call mixologists) create an account, they can start to create cocktails.  If an alcohol they want is not currently in the database, they can create one and it will be added to the database for next time.  This is true for garnishes as well, since it seems like nowadays, people can get really creative with them.  

Once logged in, a mixologist can look at all the cocktails they have made or at the complete list.  And for fun, I created an option to have the app randomly pick a cocktail for you to try out.  But that is only for the truly daring.  Mixologists are allowed to edit their cocktails but no one elses.  And if you are smart enough to be an Admin, you can actually get a list of all the mixologists that have registered and account.  Lastly, you have the option of logging in via facebook.  

Remember, please drink responsibly.
