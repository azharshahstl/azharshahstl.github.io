Well, after what seems like forever, I finally reach my final project with Flatiron.  It is a React based app with Redux to maintain state and utilized Thunk to handle my fetch requests.  Of course, it utilized a Rails API for the backend.  And I must admit, I learned a lot about React while slugging my way through this project.

My project is call "Family Recipes".  I took inspiration from my niece who wants to store our family recipes online for the whole family to enjoy.  It's not a social networking app where you can share your recipes with anyone and everyone.  Nope, this was solely for the individual families who just need a safe browser-based place to keep their memories.  

I decided to have users create an account in order to maintain privacy and control over their family recipes.  Once logged in, they will see a recipe input form and a clickable list of all the recipes they have inputed.  If they click on recipe name, the details of the recipe will appear allowing them to follow along the instructions and cook!  If, for some reason, you want to get rid of a particular recipe, you can by clicking the delete button.  

While building this App, I gained a really good appreciation for React, Redux and Thunk and I am looking foward to build a bigger and more complex App using them in the near future.
