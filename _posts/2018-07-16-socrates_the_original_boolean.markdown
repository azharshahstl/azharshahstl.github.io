Like many people nowadays, I come to programming later in life.  The last 18+ years of my life (my entire professional life), I have been a physical therapist.  And when I decided it was time for a change, I felt comfortable reaching back to what seemed like a previous life: my undergraduate years.  

As I have progressed through my Flatiron courses, I realized quickly, that Booleans play a very major role in the behavior of a program.  In a way, it feels like the heart of how you move through your methods.  And as I thought about how lines of code can be executed based on their truthiness, it occured to me that the program has no "choice" in the matter.  What I mean by that is , if I have an "If" statment and I want the code after the to run if the condition evaluates to "true", then the program will do exactly that.  In a way, it is "compelled" to do it.  It really has not choice in the matter.  In a way, it executes the code because it "knows" it to be "true".  Which leads me to Socrates.

"Socrates?", you say.  Well, in my previous life as a philosphy and math major, I fell in love with how I think Socrates saw the world.  In many ways, it was Boolean (at least in terms of moral behavior, doing the right thing, etc).  What do I mean by that?  Well, to put it simply, if you know(and I mean really know) that doing a certain action is "good", you really have no choice in the matter.  You must do it.  In fact, you will do because why would you not do something that is a "good" thing to do.  So in many ways, we really don't have a choice in the matter.  That is if you know what is truly "good".  We are compelled to do what is "good" just like a particular line of code of executed if "true".  

"But what about free will?", you say.  Well, that idea really didn't exist till St. Thomas Aquinas.  He needed free will to get his philosophy off the ground.  But for me, I really don't think we need it to exist.  We will do "good" when we know it to be true, just like a program.  And I don't see anything wrong with that.
