As it is, I am a 48 year old physical therapist.  I have been one for 18 years and even owned a clinic for 7 years.  But, as it happens to many people, around 2 years ago, I started looking ahead and realized that I did not want to be a PT anymore.  In a very deep way, it was becoming unsatisfying.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the interaction with the patients, I REALLY loved the problem solving when trying to get to the root cause of the physical alignment, but the actual intervention, the "PT part" of it all was slowly becoming less interesting.

After much soul searching, I realized what I missed was my simpler life when I was an undegrad.  What? you ask.  Well, as a math and philosophy major, life sure seemed simpler.  Especially the math part.  What I loved about solving math problems was that ultimately, you either had the right answer or the wrong one.  And you could figure that out by testing the results.  It was straight-forward and truly satisfying.  As I was looking for something to replace PT, it became clear to me that I needed to move out of the cloud of PT and into the clarity of logic and math.  And since I occasionally would dabble in computer science/programming, it seemed logical to look into making it my next profession.  

And so, as a middle-aged man, I am undergoing what friends have called a "professional mid-life crisis".  I have no problem with that label.  It's not all that far off from the truth.   To the next twenty years!
