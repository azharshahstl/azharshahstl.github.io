About a month ago, I was lucky to meet a young man who was a life coach.  No, I wasn't looking for one, and this isn't about the usefullness of a life coach, but more about how being in the right place at the right time can really make a difference.  So I met this gentleman, and we started talking.  He wanted to know what I was working on.  I told him my updated response.  "It's complicated".  But eventually, I explained to him I am in flatiron's on-line web development track and he wanted to know if I had heard of Venture Cafe.  

I had not heard of it and he went on to explain that it's a place where innovators, creators, people seeking jobs, and employers looking for the next best empoyee all meet, have a few beers, eat pizza and talk about all things, technical and otherwise.  I couldn't believe it.  It sounded like just the thing I have been hoping to find in St. Louis.  Turns out, it started in Boston and St. Louis was the first city they expaned to!  Wow, some good news about St. Louis for a change. :)  

The next Thursday, I went there and I have to say, it was about as cool of an experience you could have.  There was an introductory session which all newbies could attend (if they so choose.  You are not obligated to attend any of their sessions).  We wear name tags......all of us.....every time we go.  Which is awesome, because now I don't have to feel like an idiot because I don't remember the name of the person I have spent the last 20 minutes talking to.  After the intro session, you are free to mingle, strike up conversations with whomever you want.  There are session/lectures put on by volunteers about almost any topic you can imagine.  I have seen a lecture on "What I went through to create my web application" to "Yogo and mindfulness".  The point is, the people here are creative and have ideas they want to share.  If I were a teenager in the 60's, I imagine this would be kind of like that, only with a greater tech presence, and free beer instead of ....

I am looking forward to making Venture Cafe a regular part of my life.  And who knows, maybe one day, I will present a lecture my experience of developing a web app and talk about how flatiron changed my life.
